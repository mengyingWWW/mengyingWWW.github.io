    Flushing is one of the world’s largest Chinatowns, with a rich and woven cultural
history. This project studies Chinese elements in Flushing through a multisensory
lens—using street view texts, audios from walking tour videos, and food as cultural
symbols. It also explores how diverse cultures merge, highlighting what makes
Flushing a diverse community. We use machine learning to assess the proportions
of Chinese and other cultures across visual, aural, and gustatory dimensions, then
we use data visualization to show the coexistence of Chinese and other cultures
across these three sensory dimensions.
