    Flushing is one of the world’s largest Chinatowns, with a rich and woven cultural
history. This project studies Chinese elements in Flushing through a multisensory
lens—using street view texts, audios from walking tour videos, and food as cultural
symbols. It also explores how diverse cultures merge, highlighting what makes
Flushing a diverse community. We use machine learning to assess the proportions
of Chinese and other cultures across visual, aural, and gustatory dimensions, then
we use data visualization to show the coexistence of Chinese and other cultures
across these three sensory dimensions.

## Background
![Figure placeholder]({{ '/projects/research_0/assets/Frame 2.png' | relative_url }})
Flushing, located in Queens, New York, is a diverse neighborhood with a rich history that has shaped its cultural character. While Flushing’s rich history has cultivated deep multicultural fusion, it is predominantly recognized today as one of the world’s largest Chinatown. This dominant perception often
overshadows the diverse cultural integration shaped by not only Chinese, Korean, and Indian communities, but also earlier influences from European colonizers and other immigrant groups. Our research aims to fill this gap by applying machine learning to study the multisensory composition of Chinese
elements and their integration with other cultural features, offering new insights into Flushing’s complex identity.
